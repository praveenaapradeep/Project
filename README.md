Stock Market Prediction Analysis

Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to predict the stock prices of Google and Facebook using advanced deep learning techniques. The goal was to build models capable of forecasting future stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights for investment decisions.The NYSE Securities dataset provides information on securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This dataset includes details about the securities, such as their symbols, names, and other identifying information. It is valuable for analyzing the stock market and performing financial research.
